## Credits

- My setup was heavily inspired by this reddit [user](https://www.reddit.com/user/K_AON/). I saw their post on `r/UNIXPORN` and decided yeah, "I fw this", so I just want to give them a credit for it.

- .zshrc config and some default tmux config is entirely based on [Dreams of Autonomys's](https://www.youtube.com/@dreamsofautonomy/featured) youtube channel. I highly recommend it if you're into these things.
