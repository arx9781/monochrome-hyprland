[!NOTE]
This setup contains dotfiles that i made and assembled according to my preferences. There may be some things that might not work for you if you decide to copy/clone this repo, so proceed with caution as your mileage may vary.

## Credits

My setup was heavily inspired by the reddit [user](https://www.reddit.com/user/K_AON/). I saw their post on `r/UNIXPORN` and decided yeah, "I fw this", so I just want to give them a credit for this.

.zshrc config is entirely based on `Dreams of Autonomy's` [video](https://youtu.be/ud7YxC33Z3w?si=GAMewAdr28qoBftJ), I recommend the channel if you are interested in these things.
