# Wallpaper Collection
A collection of wallpapers I use and keep. It follows a very simple convention of numbered images, 
where `b` stands for `background` and
`n` are the `serial numbers` of the images start from 1.

If you notice there are some images that don't follow the convention, thats because they're special dark/light mode wallpapers,
where `bd` stands for `background dynamic` and
`n` is the serial number and `L/D` means their variant, so essentially `Light` or `Dark`

<b>Image attributions go their respective owners<b>, I just collected and saved the images for my personal use.
